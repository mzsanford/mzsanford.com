      | I get sick of seeing resumes that tell <strong>only half of the story</strong>. I've taken the totally open approach to me resume.
      | I've included not just the companies I've worked for, or just the positions I held there, I've provided details
      | about the projects I worked on. Better yet, I've <strong>included the contact for people who took over those projects</strong>
      | after me. I am guessing about half of those people will have negative comments but you know what, that's what happens
      | when a problem outgrows the code you wrote for it. I have not included the day-to-day bug fixes and roadmap items I worked
      | on since that seems unhelpful.
