      | I've taken the totally open approach to my resume.
      | I've included not just the companies I've worked for, or just the positions I held there, but I've provided details
      | about the projects I worked on. Better yet, I've <strong>included the contact for people who took over those projects</strong>
      | after me, where available. I am guessing about half of those people will have negative comments but that's what happens
      | when a problem outgrows the code you wrote for it. I have not included the day-to-day bug fixes and roadmap items I worked
      | on since that seems unhelpful. I believe that if you're reading this you should understand that an acceptable solution today
      | might not appropriate a year from now. I solve problems with an eye toward the future but without a crystal ball.

                | European and US account systems, for which I was able to lend a hand on both design and implementation.

                    | eventually shut down after the search logs in question were found to be less anonymous that thought.

                    | and while the filing was easier the work done implementing it was wide ranging and difficult.
