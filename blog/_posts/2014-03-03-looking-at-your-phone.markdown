title: Looking at Your Phone is Having a Side Conversation

When you're with someone and you look at your phone it should be considered socially equivalent to having a side conversation. There are times when a side conversation makes complete sense but not nearly as often as we all look at our phones, to be sure. Thinking of it this way is my first step to correcting a bad behavior in myself.

### A Side Conversation with Nobody

There are times when a side conversation makes complete sense, A good example is when you ask a 3rd party for something very quickly (can you grab me a drink? What was that one guys name?). Your phone can handle some of those same needs (How many people really *do* live in Montana?) but it's important to treat your phone as attention sink it can be.

If I find myself reading the whole Wikipedia article on Montana (which has some interesting tidbits) I've overstepped a social bound that I wouldn't have if that phone were just a really knowledgeable friend from Montana. When it comes to real people I might ask Mike from Montana how many people live there. If he tells me and I turn back to my original conversation that's all normal. If Mike answers my question and then spends 5 minutes telling me all about Montana's disputes with Native Americans in the late 1800's **out of ear-shot of my original conversation** I would know that feels wrong.

With a phone I (and many people I see) somehow fall into the trap of reading right in front of someone else. I'm having a private side conversation with nobody. I can tell myself that I am learning something. I can tell myself that I'll relate these exciting new lessons to my friend. Many times there is nothing great to tell. Many times when I lookup my friend is also looking down an their phone. I have killed the conversation.

### What Now?

I am making an effort to think of my phone as a very knowledgeable friend. Someone I can ask questions of but who I only have a full-fledged *conversation* with when I'm not already occupied in conversation. Waiting for the bus? Check. Toddler napping? Check. Quiet moment between other conversations? Sure (but within a reasonable limit). Conversation: "[Her life is in your hands, Dude.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?item=qt0520371)".
